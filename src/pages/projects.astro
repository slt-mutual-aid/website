      <h2>Future Project Ideas</h2>
      <p>
        Do you have ideas on how to make these mutual aid projects successful? Reach out to 
        <a href="mailto:slt-mutualaid@proton.me">slt-mutualaid@proton.me</a> or one of the admins via Signal and we will help you get started.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some mutual aid ideas that need your input to get started:</p>

      <article class="project">
        <h3>Lending Library/Library of Things</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Lending items to each other and/or creating centralized lending libraries. Example: Need a mixer for a weekend every now and then. Instead of purchasing a new one that will sit in a cupboard for 3 weeks out of the month, borrow someone else's that is sitting in the cupboard waiting to be used. Also, an individual can create a centralized library such as a tool box library where people can donate their tools and it becomes a lending library for the community.
        </p>
        <p class="goal">
          <strong>Goal:</strong> Lend/borrow items that are needed rather than purchase new items. Creating community through lending/borrowing connections.

        <h3>Fix-it Clinics/Repair cafes/Makerspace</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Are you good at sewing? Do you need something sewed? Do you have skills in soldering? Were you about to throw out that metal strainer whose handle came off? Let's match the need with the skill in a fix-it clinic/repair café. Truckee Roundhouse is a makerspace "that supports the teaching, learning, and practicing of a wide variety of crafts, skills, technologies, and arts in the Truckee-Tahoe community." Could we offer a mutual aid makerspace at different sites in South Tahoe?
        </p>
        <p class="goal"><strong>Goal:</strong> Keep items out of the landfill and create community connections.</p>

        <h3>Community Gardens</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Do you have space that you have dreamt of turning into a garden? Why not make it a community garden? Do you have skills in gardening that we can learn from? Imagine South Lake Tahoe full of community garden spaces that we can take care of and be nourished by.
        </p>
        <p class="goal">
          <strong>Goal:</strong> To create renewable food sources within the South Lake Tahoe community that creates connection and responds to the need of food insecurity.

        <h3>Time Swapping</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Instead of exchanging money, we exchange time. Example: One person needs their dog walked while someone else needs help with hemming their pants – they trade their time instead of spending money on these services. 1 hour equals 1 hour. Another Example: childcare swapping – instead of paying for childcare, you create time swapping for childcare.
        </p>
        <p class="goal"><strong>Goal:</strong> Create community connections and trade time rather than money.</p>

        <h3>Community Little Exchange, Free item, sidewalk joy boxes</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Similar to little free libraries that have book exchanges, we could do all sorts of small items: Mug exchanges, keychain exchanges, Zine exchanges, Sticker exchange, magnet exchange or even a small food pantry. We would need these things to be able to be set up in businesses in the winter and definitely cannot do outside food pantries due to the wildlife. Along this same line – can we create a map of free bins to get out to the public? People volunteer during Spring – Fall to put out Free bins of items. These can be tubs/bins that stay in a specific spot with a lid for when it rains and people grab what they need.
        </p>
        <p class="goal">
          <strong>Goal:</strong> To create community connections and exchange items rather than buy new items.

        <h3>Mutual Aid Disaster Relief</h3>
        <p class="description">
          "Solidarity, not charity. Mutual Aid Disaster Relief is a grassroots disaster relief network based on the principles of solidarity, mutual aid, and autonomous direct action. By working with, listening to, and supporting impacted communities, especially their most vulnerable members, to lead their own recovery, we build long-term, sustainable and resilient communities." (From link). Can we find a way to help our vulnerable neighbors during power/internet/water/gas outages and also during fire, snow, evacuation, and winter storms? Can we find a way to share equipment, food, necessities, resources as needed? Do you know your neighbors? Do you know who could use extra help? How do we best reach and help them in times of crisis or disaster?
        </p>
        <p class="goal">
          <strong>Goal:</strong> Connecting individuals and communities to assist one another during crisis, emergencies, outages, or natural disasters.
