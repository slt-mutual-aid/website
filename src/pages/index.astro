      <h2>What is Mutual Aid?</h2>
      <p>
        Mutual aid is a form of solidarity-based support where community members
        come together to meet each other's needs. It's about neighbors helping
        neighbors, creating networks of care and support that strengthen our
        community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutual aid is built on principles of cooperation, reciprocity, and
        collective care. It recognizes that we all have something to contribute
        and that we all may need support at different times in our lives.
      </p>

      <h2>What Mutual Aid Is Not</h2>
      <p>
        Mutual aid is not charity. It's not a one-way relationship where some
        people give and others receive. Instead, it's a reciprocal system where
        everyone can both give and receive support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutual aid is not about means-testing or determining who "deserves"
        help. It operates on the principle that everyone deserves support and
        that we're all better off when we take care of each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutual aid is not a replacement for government services or social safety
        nets. It's a complementary approach that builds community resilience and
        creates networks of support that exist alongside formal systems.
